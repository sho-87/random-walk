# Random Walk

**Ever wanted to go for a walk and not have to think about where you're going?**

**Ever wanted to randomly explore an area without having to choose a walking direction?**

This is a very simple Android app that will randomly choose a walking direction for you!

When you get to an intersection, or experience a moment of indecision, just select the possible walking directions in the app and it will randomly pick one for you!
